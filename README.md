## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: The user interface is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern declarative UI framework.

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern, separating data (Model), UI (View), and logic (ViewModel) for maintainability and testability.
- **Firebase Integration**: The app leverages Firebase for app crashlytics, app analytics, app performance. 

- **SSL Pinning**: To enhance security, the app implements SSL pinning, ensuring that it securely communicates with the backend servers. SSL pinning guards against potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
